Scope and Purpose
The global financial infrastructure is undergoing a period of profound transformation, characterized by the convergence of physical access points and sophisticated digital ecosystems. For an institution of the scale and complexity of xxplaceholderxx, the security of Self-Service Terminals (SSTs) is not merely a localized operational concern but a critical pillar of the bank’s broader cyber-resilience strategy.1 This technical security standard provides a comprehensive, mandatory framework for the design, implementation, and lifecycle management of all SST assets, including Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), Video Teller Machines (VTMs)—also referred to as Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs)—Cash Deposit Machines (CDMs), and Cash Recycler Machines (CRMs). As these devices evolve into powerful edge computing nodes that handle increasingly complex transaction types, the necessity for a unified, world-class security standard becomes paramount.3
The scope of this standard encompasses the entire functional architecture of the SST environment, reaching beyond the physical chassis to include the internal hardware components, the multi-vendor software stack, network communication protocols, and the backend host integration layers.6 It applies to all SST deployments across the bank's global footprint, ensuring that whether a terminal is situated in a high-traffic metro branch or a remote non-metro location, it adheres to the same rigorous defensive posture.9 Furthermore, this standard governs the security expectations for all internal stakeholders and third-party service providers involved in terminal manufacturing, maintenance, cash-in-transit (CIT) services, and logical monitoring.11
The primary purpose of this documentation is to establish a "Security-by-Design" and "Compliance-by-Design" culture that aligns with the bank’s "shift-left" engineering philosophy.1 By embedding security controls directly into the deployment pipeline and hardware selection criteria, the bank reduces its gross risk and ensures that residual risk remains within the approved appetite.1 This standard is fundamentally designed to harmonize the requirements of global industry frameworks—most notably the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS v4.0.1), PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS) v7.0, and NIST Special Publication 800-53—with the specific regulatory mandates of jurisdictions like the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).9

The overarching objective is to protect the bank’s financial assets, customer data, and brand reputation from a threat landscape that is increasingly industrialized and automated.21 This standard serves as the blueprint for building a resilient terminal fleet that can withstand the diverse array of physical and logical attacks prevalent in today’s environment, while simultaneously facilitating a seamless and secure experience for the bank’s affluent and internationally active customers.1
Key Risks
The risk landscape for Self-Service Terminals has evolved from opportunistic, low-tech theft to a state of highly coordinated, multi-vector warfare. Modern adversaries leverage a combination of brute-force physical methods, sophisticated malware-as-a-service platforms, and AI-driven social engineering to exploit any perceived weakness in the terminal fleet.21 For xxplaceholderxx, identifying and quantifying these risks across its global estate is critical for prioritizing security investments and operational focus.1
Physical and Brute-Force Exploitation
Physical attacks remain a constant threat, often resulting in significant property damage and total asset loss. Criminal groups have become more brazen, utilizing heavy vehicles for ram-raid attacks to forcibly remove terminals from their mountings.22 Additionally, the use of explosive materials has shifted toward gas-based attacks, where flammable gases are injected into the safe and ignited, causing catastrophic failures of the chassis and vault.17 These attacks are typically executed in under five minutes, necessitating detection and delay mechanisms that can operate faster than a human response.19

Direct financial loss and equipment replacement costs.

Logical Attacks and the Industrialization of Malware
The transition of SSTs to standardized operating systems (primarily Windows 10/11) has made them susceptible to the same malware families that plague the broader IoT and corporate environments.26 "Jackpotting"—the logical equivalent of a physical breach—involves the installation of malicious software (such as "black-box" devices or specialized malware like HybridPetya) to issue fraudulent commands directly to the cash dispenser.17 The emergence of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allows even low-skilled actors to deploy sophisticated "EDR killers" and AI-powered ransomware like PromptLock to encrypt terminal data and hold the bank to ransom.23 These attacks often leverage "black boxes"—unauthorized external devices connected directly to the dispenser's internal port after a physical breach of the terminal’s head compartment.17
Data Interception and Identity Fraud
Skimming and shimming are the primary methods used to compromise cardholder data at the point of interaction. Skimming devices, now frequently created using 3D printing and miniaturized electronics, are attached to the exterior of the card reader to capture magnetic stripe data.17 Shimming represents a more sophisticated threat, involving the insertion of a paper-thin device into the reader that intercepts the communication between the terminal and the EMV chip, capturing data that can be used to create cloned cards or perform fraudulent online transactions.17 Furthermore, the use of pinhole cameras to record PIN entry continues to be a persistent risk, often facilitated by "social engineering" where fraudsters distract the customer during their transaction.18
Network and Distributed Edge Risks
As SSTs move to the network edge, using 5G/LTE and cloud-integrated management, the risks of network interception and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks increase significantly.5 If the communication between the terminal and the backend host is not protected by strong, mutual authentication and high-grade encryption (TLS 1.3), an attacker can intercept the traffic and issue spoofed authorization responses.6 Additionally, the distributed nature of the fleet creates a challenge for consistent policy enforcement. "Configuration drift"—where a terminal’s security settings deviate from the bank’s baseline over time—can create openings for attackers to exploit legacy protocols or unpatched services.30
Emerging AI-Driven Threats
The convergence of artificial intelligence and cybercrime has introduced a new class of threats. Generative AI is now being used to craft highly personalized phishing campaigns and deepfake voice or video communications that can trick bank employees or CIT technicians into granting unauthorized physical access to terminal components.4 These human-centric vulnerabilities are amplified by the "balkanized" nature of global data protection regulations, which can complicate the centralized monitoring and response efforts needed to combat such sophisticated actors.1
Security Principles
The technical security standard is founded on a set of core principles that ensure a proactive, layered, and data-centric approach to defense. These principles are designed to align with xxplaceholderxx’s architectural vision of creating a resilient and autonomous security environment.1
Defense-in-Depth and Multi-Layered Protection
A core tenet of this standard is that security must not rely on any single control. The bank adopts a defense-in-depth strategy where multiple independent layers of security work in concert.1 If a physical safe is breached, the cash neutralization system renders the assets unusable; if the operating system is compromised, the application whitelisting prevents the execution of malicious code; if the terminal is isolated from the network, the host-level firewall and internal segmentation prevent lateral movement.22 This multi-layered approach ensures that a failure in one domain does not lead to a total compromise of the terminal.28
Zero Trust and the "Never Trust, Always Verify" Model
xxplaceholderxx is transitioning its edge infrastructure to a Zero Trust architecture.5 In this model, the location of the terminal—whether inside a secure branch or on a public street—does not grant it an implicit level of trust.5 Every access request, whether for a customer transaction, a maintenance session, or a remote software update, must be verified through strong identity-based authentication and continuous monitoring.5 This principles-based approach focuses on protecting the data and the session rather than just the network perimeter.1
Data-Centric Protection and Integrity
The security posture of an SST is defined primarily by the data it processes. The bank’s standard ensures that sensitive production data is handled with production-level security at every touchpoint.1 This means that cardholder data (CHD) and sensitive authentication data (SAD) are encrypted from the moment they are captured by the terminal hardware until they reach the secure decryption environment in the backend.11 The integrity of the data and the system itself is maintained through cryptographic measures, such as TPM-rooted measured boot and TR-31 key blocks, which prevent unauthorized modifications or "key-swapping" attacks.24
Proactive Resilience and Automated Response
Static security is insufficient in a world of automated, high-speed attacks. The bank’s principle of proactive resilience emphasizes the need for real-time monitoring and automated countermeasures.1 By integrating SST logs into a distributed, multi-cloud lakehouse architecture, the bank can achieve an 80% reduction in time to detect incidents and a 92% faster threat investigation period.34 Automation is used to "intercept and analyze code in real-time" and to deploy countermeasures, such as terminal isolation or dispenser lockdown, in near-real-time when a threat is detected.1
Transparency, Governance, and Lifecycle Accountability
Finally, the standard is built on the principle of accountability. Every SST component must have a clearly defined owner, and every security control must be auditable and evidence-based.41 This includes maintaining a comprehensive inventory of hardware and software assets and ensuring that the entire lifecycle—from secure manufacturing to final decommissioning—is governed by a robust technology risk management framework.6

Core Technical Security Standard Statements
These core technical standard statements represent the mandatory requirements for all SST units within xxplaceholderxx’s global fleet. Each statement is mapped to the relevant industry benchmarks to ensure global interoperability and regulatory compliance.
1. Physical Fortification and Asset Recovery
Standard Statement: All SST units must be installed in a manner that maximizes deterrence, detection, and delay of physical attacks. This includes the use of UL-291 or equivalent high-security safes, anti-ram raid plinths, and integrated GPS-based tracking for asset recovery.
Context and Mechanism: Physical security is the first line of defense. The bank requires that all terminals be anchored using high-tensile bolts and reinforced with anti-ram raid mounting plates and shutter protection plates.24 These measures are designed to increase the time required for a brute-force attack, providing a vital "delay" window for law enforcement response.22 Furthermore, terminals must be equipped with physical tracking devices that remain active even if the main power is severed, allowing for the immediate location and recovery of stolen units.22
Rationale: The 149% surge in ATM-related thefts highlights the need for a more robust physical posture.22 Without proper perimeter protection and anchoring, terminals are vulnerable to vehicle-based "smash-and-grab" raids that result in immediate financial and structural loss.22
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI DSS v4.0.1: Requirement 9.1 (Restrict physical access to cardholder data).
NIST SP 800-53 R5: PE-3 (Physical Access Control) and PE-6 (Monitoring Physical Access).13
ATMIA Best Practices: Guidelines for physical security and anti-ram raid protection.44
PCI PTS v7.0: Enhanced requirements for physical tamper resistance in POI devices.16
2. Environmental Threat Mitigation and Cash Neutralization
Standard Statement: All SSTs must incorporate active environmental protection systems, including gas/smoke detection sensors and Intelligent Banknote Neutralization Systems (IBNS) that render currency unusable in the event of a successful safe breach.
Context and Mechanism: To counter the rise in gas-based explosive attacks, the bank mandates the use of specialized sensors that can detect the injection of flammable materials into the terminal enclosure.19 Upon detection, these systems can trigger a "gas-neutralization" process or a "smoke-deterrent" system that obscures the attacker's visibility.24 More critically, the terminal's cash cassettes must be equipped with ink-staining systems that automatically activate if the machine is tilted, vibrated excessively, or if the safe door is forced open.22
Rationale: Neutralizing the "reward" of an attack is the ultimate deterrent. If criminals know that the cash will be rendered worthless by ink-staining, the motivation for the attack is significantly reduced.22
Mapping and Global Standards:
NIST SP 800-53 R5: PE-13 (Fire Protection) and PE-18 (Location of Information System Components).
PCI PTS v7.0: Requirements for the physical security of the payment environment.16
RBI Circular 2024/25: Mandates for ATM security and regular physical audits.9
3. Hardware Root of Trust and Boot Integrity
Standard Statement: All SST hardware must utilize a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and UEFI Secure Boot to establish a hardware-rooted chain of trust. This must be coupled with "measured boot" processes that validate the integrity of each software layer from the BIOS to the operating system kernel.
Context and Mechanism: The TPM serves as the terminal's cryptographic anchor, storing keys that are only released if the system's hardware and firmware measurements match the "known-good" baseline.6 Secure Boot ensures that only UEFI drivers and bootloaders signed with the bank’s authorized certificates can execute.6 This prevents the execution of "boot-time" malware or the installation of rogue operating systems that could bypass logical security controls.23
Rationale: Hardware-level integrity is critical because if the boot process is compromised, all subsequent software protections are moot.24 TPM-based measured boot provides the evidence needed for "attestation," ensuring the terminal is in a trustworthy state before it is allowed to join the network.32
Mapping and Global Standards:
NIST SP 800-53 R5: SI-7 (Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity) and IA-3 (Device Identification and Authentication).30
PCI PTS v7.0: Mandatory 128-bit effective key strength for firmware authentication and device security functions.16
CIS Benchmarks: UEFI and BIOS hardening recommendations for Windows-based systems.45
4. Comprehensive Operating System Hardening
Standard Statement: The SST operating system (OS) must be hardened according to the CIS Level 2 Benchmark. This requires the removal of all non-essential components, the closure of unused network ports, and the implementation of strict local access controls.
Context and Mechanism: The bank requires the use of Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) to minimize the frequency of non-security updates and maximize system stability.8 All unnecessary features, such as "Shadow IT" components, print spoolers (if not needed), and administrative shares, must be disabled.26 Remote management must be performed through a hardened jump host (bastion host) with multi-factor authentication.6
Rationale: A "reduced attack surface" is a fundamental security best practice. By disabling unused services and ports, the bank minimizes the number of potential entry points for an attacker to gain a foothold on the terminal.35

5. Mandatory Application Whitelisting and Control
Standard Statement: All SST units must deploy a dynamic application whitelisting solution (e.g., Trellix/McAfee Solidcore) in lockdown mode. The solution must prevent the execution of any binary, script, or library that is not explicitly authorized and included in the inventory.
Context and Mechanism: Application control is the primary defense against logical attacks like jackpotting.31 The Solidcore client must be configured in "Lockdown" mode, where the local command-line interface (CLI) is protected by a unique, rotating password.50 The solution must leverage a "Reputation Intelligence" engine (e.g., TIE/GTI) to automatically classify files as good, bad, or unknown, and to "auto-immunize" the fleet against newly discovered threats.31
Rationale: Signature-based antivirus is ineffective against the custom, zero-day malware used in ATM attacks.22 Whitelisting provides a "negative trust" model that is significantly more resilient to modern threat patterns.31
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI DSS v4.0.1: Requirement 5.3 (Anti-malware mechanisms) and Requirement 5.4.1 (Automated malware scanning for removable media).38
NIST SP 800-53 R5: CM-7 (5) (White-listing) and SI-7 (15) (Code Signing and Integrity).
DISA STIG: Security Technical Implementation Guide for Trellix Application Control 8.x.50
6. Cryptographic Protection and TR-31 PIN Block Security
Standard Statement: All symmetric keys must be exchanged and stored using TR-31 Key Blocks. This technical standard replaces the use of clear-text keys or un-versioned key blocks, ensuring that every key is cryptographically bound to its intended usage and exportability attributes.
Context and Mechanism: The TR-31 standard (ANSI X9.24-1) defines a secure method for packaging a cryptographic key together with its "header" information.44 The header contains non-encrypted but authenticated data about the key usage (e.g., PIN encryption vs. MACing) and its versioning.39 This prevents an attacker from swapping a strong key for a weaker one or using a key for an unauthorized purpose.24 All new hardware acquisitions must support TR-31 natively at the EPP firmware level.27
Rationale: The 2025 PCI mandates for TR-31 are designed to eliminate the long-standing vulnerabilities associated with manual key management and legacy block formats.24 Failure to comply by the deadline leads to immediate disconnection from payment networks.24
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI PIN v3.1: Mandates the use of TR-31 key blocks for all symmetric key exchanges.24
ANSI X9 TR-31: Technical report for interoperable key block exchange.44
NIST SP 800-53 R5: SC-12 (Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management).
7. Certificate-Based Remote Key Loading (RKL)
Standard Statement: The terminal fleet must utilize TR-34 certificate-based Remote Key Loading (RKL) to transport Master Keys from the host to the EPP. This protocol eliminates the security risk of manual key loading by two-person teams.
Context and Mechanism: TR-34 (ANSI X9.24-2) uses asymmetric (public-key) cryptography to securely distribute TR-31 key blocks.39 Each terminal is injected with a unique manufacturer-signed certificate at the point of origin.54 During the RKL process, the terminal and the host perform a mutual authentication handshake; the host then encrypts the Master Key using the terminal’s public key, ensuring that only that specific terminal can decrypt and use the key.39
Rationale: Manual key loading is labor-intensive, prone to human error, and creates an opportunity for insider threats.54 TR-34 provides a scalable, future-proof, and highly secure method for fleet-wide key rotation.24
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI PIN v3.1: Requirements for RKL protocols and key transport.27

8. Micro-segmentation and Network Traffic Encryption
Standard Statement: All SST network traffic must be encapsulated in a secure tunnel (e.g., IPsec VPN or TLS 1.3) and terminated in a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) or SASE point of presence. Internal network micro-segmentation must be enforced to prevent any direct communication between terminals.
Context and Mechanism: The bank requires the use of host-level next-generation firewalls (NGFW) that provide deep packet inspection (DPI) and protocol filtering for each terminal.28 These firewalls establish a site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel back to the bank's data center, ensuring that no clear-text transaction data is ever visible on the service provider's network (e.g., 4G/5G/LTE).28 Internally, the network architecture must use micro-segmentation to ensure that an infected terminal cannot scan or attack other terminals in the same subnet.14
Rationale: The terminal’s network connection is its most vulnerable logical point. Without segmentation and encryption, an attacker who gains control of one machine or a network segment could perform a large-scale jackpotting attack across the entire fleet.5
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI DSS v4.0.1: Requirement 1.2 (Network security controls) and Requirement 4.2 (Protect cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission).11
NIST SP 800-53 R5: SC-7 (Boundary Protection) and SC-8 (Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity).30
MAS TRM 2021: Mandates for network segmentation and isolation of sensitive systems.14
9. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Administrative Access
Standard Statement: All administrative access to SSTs, including local maintenance sessions and remote management via a Terminal Management System (TMS), must require multi-factor authentication (MFA). Static passwords for privileged accounts are strictly prohibited.
Context and Mechanism: The bank mandates the use of MFA solutions that combine "something you have" (e.g., a hardware token or smartphone) with "something you know" or "something you are" (e.g., biometrics).6 For local access, technicians must use a uniquely assigned electronic key or a mobile-generated one-time password (OTP) to open the terminal’s safe or head compartment.6 For remote access, the bank uses a Privileged Access Management (PAM) system that "vaults" credentials and provides MFA-backed session monitoring.6
Rationale: Stolen or compromised administrative credentials are a leading cause of jackpotting and data breach incidents.21 MFA ensures that even if an attacker obtains a password, they cannot gain control of the machine without a second factor.37
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI DSS v4.0.1: Requirement 8.4.2 (MFA for all access to the cardholder data environment).11
NIST SP 800-53 R5: IA-2 (Identification and Authentication - Organizational Users) and AC-2 (Account Management).30
ISO 27001:2022: Control A 5.15 (Access Control) and A 5.18 (Access Rights).37
10. Point-of-Interaction (POI) Integrity and SRED
Standard Statement: All payment terminals within the SST must be PCI PTS-approved and have Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED) enabled. This ensures that card data is encrypted immediately upon capture at the read head.
Context and Mechanism: SRED-enabled readers protect account data from "memory scraping" malware that attempts to steal clear-text data while it is in the terminal’s RAM.11 When part of a PCI-listed Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) solution, the terminal hardware manages the encryption process autonomously, ensuring that no clear-text data is ever exposed to the terminal’s operating system or the bank’s internal network.11
Rationale: Protecting data at the moment of capture is the most effective way to minimize the scope of a data breach. By using SRED, the bank ensures that even a total compromise of the OS does not provide the attacker with usable cardholder data.11
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI PTS v7.0: Security requirements for PIN entry devices and card readers.16
PCI P2PE Standard: Requirements for secure encryption solutions.11
NIST SP 800-53 R5: SC-13 (Cryptographic Protection).
11. Centralized Real-Time Monitoring and Log Intelligence
Standard Statement: All SST units must transmit security-relevant logs in real-time to the bank’s centralized SIEM platform. The logging configuration must cover physical sensor events, system integrity alerts, and transactional anomalies.
Context and Mechanism: xxplaceholderxx utilizes a Databricks-based "Lakehouse" architecture to aggregate and analyze billions of security events from its global estate.34 SSTs must log events such as safe door openings, unexpected reboots, communication outages, and any blocked execution attempts by the whitelisting client.6 Machine learning models are applied to this data to identify patterns indicative of "cash-out" attacks or hardware tampering in progress.28
Rationale: Rapid detection is essential for mitigating the impact of an attack. Without centralized, real-time logging, a terminal could be compromised and "emptied" of cash before the bank’s security operations center (SOC) is even aware of the incident.6
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI DSS v4.0.1: Requirement 10.4.1 (Automated log reviews and real-time alerts).15
NIST SP 800-53 R5: AU-2 (Event Logging) and AU-6 (Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting).13

12. Biometric and Third-Party App Segregation (PTS v7.0)
Standard Statement: SSTs incorporating biometric sensors or third-party non-payment applications must comply with the segregation requirements of PCI PTS v7.0. Biometric data must be isolated in a secure execution environment, and third-party apps must be sandboxed to prevent access to clear-text account data.
Context and Mechanism: The latest PCI PTS standard (v7.0) introduces mandatory "sandboxing" for third-party applications, such as loyalty programs or advertising modules.29 These applications must run in a separate execution space that has no logical access to the payment application or the card reader’s data output.29 For biometric sensors (e.g., fingerprint or face), the biometric templates must be stored and processed within a secure cryptographic module that provides at least 128-bit effective key strength.16
Rationale: As terminals become more multi-functional, the risk of a non-critical application being used as a side-channel to steal data increases.29 Segregation ensures that the "high-security" payment functions are protected from vulnerabilities in lower-security consumer apps.29
Mapping and Global Standards:
PCI PTS v7.0: New requirements for biometric interface security and third-party application sandboxing.16
NIST SP 800-76-2: Biometric specifications for personal identity verification.61
FIPS 201: Standard for identity verification and biometric data protection.
Implementation and Lifecycle Governance
The technical standards outlined above are supported by a rigorous governance framework that ensures the continuous security of the SST fleet throughout its operational lifecycle. xxplaceholderxx’s approach is defined by accountability, transparency, and a commitment to maintaining the highest standard of care.12
Vendor and Supply Chain Security
Before any terminal model or software version is approved for deployment, it must undergo a comprehensive security evaluation. The bank requires its hardware vendors and software providers to provide an Attestation of Compliance (AoC) and to demonstrate adherence to the PCI SSC's Secure Software Standard.7 This ensures that the components are manufactured in a secure environment and that "backdoors" or vulnerabilities are not introduced during the supply chain process.14
Configuration Management and Audit Readiness
The bank utilizes automated configuration management tools to enforce the security baseline across the global fleet.30 Any terminal that deviates from the approved configuration (e.g., a disabled whitelisting service or an unpatched OS) is automatically flagged for remediation.31 The bank conducts internal audits twice yearly and independent TRM reviews at least every three years to verify the effectiveness of these controls.14 Documentation, including log files, change management records, and vendor contracts, is maintained in an "audit-ready" state to facilitate regulatory inspections.14
Incident Response and Resilience Testing
In accordance with MAS TRM and other regulatory expectations, xxplaceholderxx maintains a formal Incident Response Plan (IRP) specifically for its SST estate.14 This plan is tested annually through "cybersecurity exercises" that simulate real-world attack tactics, such as jackpotting or complex coordinated physical-logical attacks.12 The bank also employs a "Blue Team" for continuous monitoring and a "Red Team" for periodic penetration testing to identify and remediate weaknesses before they can be exploited by adversaries.14
Future Outlook and Strategic Considerations
The technical security standard for Self-Service Terminals is a living document, designed to evolve alongside the threat landscape and technological innovations. Looking forward, the bank is monitoring several key areas that will influence the next generation of SST security.
Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
The Accredited Standards Committee X9 is already researching the impact of quantum computing on financial systems.44 As quantum processors become more powerful, current asymmetric encryption methods like RSA (used in TR-34 RKL) may become vulnerable. xxplaceholderxx is monitoring the development of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to ensure its SST fleet remains resilient to "harvest-now, decrypt-later" attacks.27
Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Defense
xxplaceholderxx is firmly in the "innovation camp" when it comes to utilizing AI for security.1 Future SST security architectures will likely feature "intelligent gateways" that use on-device machine learning to detect and block malicious behavior at the edge, even when disconnected from the central SIEM.4 This "autonomous edge security" will provide a critical layer of protection for terminals in regions with unreliable network connectivity.
Convergence of Digital and Physical Identities
The bank is moving toward a set of global data platforms built on the principles of federation and orchestration.1 This will allow for a more seamless integration of biometric identities across the SST fleet, mobile banking apps, and physical branch locations, ensuring a consistent and highly secure experience for the bank’s affluent and internationally active customers.1
By adhering to these rigorous technical standards and remaining at the forefront of security innovation, xxplaceholderxx ensures the long-term integrity of its terminal fleet and the continued trust of its global customer base. The technical standard for Self-Service Terminals is not just a regulatory necessity; it is a strategic asset that enables the bank to innovate safely and grow its cross-border business with confidence.
