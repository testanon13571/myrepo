The evolution of retail banking has reached a critical juncture where the physical and digital realms converge at the Self-Service Terminal (SST). As a world-class principal security architect for a global financial institution like XXXX, the mandate is to ensure that the distributed estate of automated hardware remains resilient against an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. This technical security standard provides a rigorous framework for the deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management of all SSTs, ensuring that technological innovation does not outpace the institution’s risk appetite or regulatory obligations.1
In the contemporary banking environment, the term "ATM" no longer captures the full breadth of customer interaction hardware. The portfolio has expanded to include Video Teller Machines (VTMs), Cash Recycling Machines (CRMs), Multi-Function Machines (MFMs), and specialized deposit units.4 Each of these devices represents a complex intersection of mechanical engineering, internet-of-things (IoT) connectivity, and high-stakes financial processing. Consequently, the security architecture must address a multi-vector threat profile that encompasses physical brute force, sophisticated logical exploits, and complex social engineering.7
The global nature of XXXX’s operations necessitates a standard that is both granular enough to satisfy the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), yet flexible enough to be implemented across diverse markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.6 This document serves as the definitive technical baseline for all SST-related initiatives, ensuring that every terminal, regardless of its geographic location, adheres to a "Zero Trust" security philosophy.1
1. Scope and Purpose
The scope of this technical security standard is comprehensive, covering the entire lifecycle and technical stack of the bank’s Self-Service Terminal estate. It applies to all hardware units owned, operated, or branded by the institution, including those managed by third-party service providers. The technological breadth of this standard is designed to address the unique security requirements of various machine categories, ensuring that specialized functions—such as cash recycling or video conferencing—are protected with appropriate controls.4
1.1 Definition of Self-Service Terminals (SST)
For the purposes of this standard, the SST estate is categorized by functional complexity and risk profile. The architectural requirements vary depending on the capabilities of the specific hardware unit.

Terminal Category
Technical Definition and Primary Use Case
Risk Profile Maturity
Automated Teller Machines (ATM)
Traditional units providing cash withdrawal, balance inquiries, and PIN management via the ATM rails.5
High (Direct cash exposure)
Video Teller Machines (VTM/ITM)
High-functioning kiosks integrating live video assistance, document scanning, and biometric authentication for core-integrated transactions.5
Very High (PII and remote session risk)
Cash Deposit Machines (CDM)
Units designed for bulk intake of currency or checks, often utilizing imaging technology for real-time verification.6
Medium (Theft and counterfeit risk)
Cash Recycling Machines (CRM)
Advanced terminals that authenticate deposited cash and immediately re-dispense it for withdrawals, optimizing cash logistics.12
Very High (Counterfeit recirculation risk)
Multi-Function Machines (MFM)
Devices that combine banking services with peripheral functions like document printing, scanning, and public utility payments.6
High (Data remnant and network risk)
Cheque Deposit Machines
Specialized units for the truncation and processing of negotiable instruments.6
Medium (Fraud and image integrity risk)

The purpose of this document is to establish a mandatory technical baseline that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial services delivered via the SST channel.18 It serves to align the institution’s global operations with the following strategic objectives:
Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring absolute adherence to international mandates such as PCI DSS v4.0, which introduces strict requirements for Encrypting PIN Pads (EPP) and key management.1
Physical and Logical Convergence: Bridging the gap between traditional physical security (safes, locks, sensors) and modern cybersecurity (whitelisting, encryption, network segmentation).9
Operational Resilience: Implementing controls that satisfy the MAS TRM Guidelines and HKMA TM-E-1 requirements for system availability, performance monitoring, and rapid recovery from disruptions.6
Trust Preservation: Maintaining customer confidence by protecting sensitive authentication data (SAD) and preventing the loss of assets through criminal exploitation.22
1.2 Strategic Context and The "Zero Trust" Philosophy
The transition from standalone, legacy terminals to hyper-connected SSTs requires a fundamental shift in the security mindset. We no longer assume the internal network or the physical housing of the terminal is a "safe zone." Every component—from the BIOS and the operating system to the peripheral USB devices and the network packet—must be explicitly verified.1 This standard mandates the implementation of "Zero Trust" principles within the SST architecture, ensuring that trust is never implicit and is always dynamically validated.1
2. Top 10 Key Risks in the Self-Service Terminal Environment
As the global bank's principal security architect, identifying and quantifying the risks facing the SST estate is a prerequisite for developing effective controls. The following top 10 risks represent the most critical threats identified through forensic analysis, industry intelligence from the ATM Security Association (ASA), and predictive modeling for the 2025-2026 threat horizon.25
2.1 Logical "Jackpotting" and Black Box Attacks
Logical attacks represent the most significant shift in the SST threat landscape. Jackpotting involves the unauthorized dispense of cash from an ATM or CRM by exploiting software or hardware vulnerabilities.8 In a "black box" attack, the criminal physically breaches the terminal's fascia to gain access to the internal PC or the dispenser's communication cables. They then connect an external device (the "black box") that sends unauthorized commands directly to the dispenser, bypassing the terminal's security software and host authentication.3 The risk is exacerbated by outdated operating systems that lack modern hardware-root-of-trust features.2
2.2 Advanced Shimming and EMV Exploitation
While the global migration to EMV (chip-and-pin) has drastically reduced traditional magnetic stripe skimming, it has given rise to "shimming." Shimmers are incredibly thin devices inserted into the card reader to intercept the communication between the card's microchip and the terminal.25 Although shimming cannot clone an EMV chip, it allows attackers to harvest enough data to create a fraudulent magnetic stripe card that can still be used in non-EMV-compliant regions or at terminals that fail to perform secondary validation of the Integrated Card Validation Code (ICVC).28
2.3 Explosive and Brute-Force Physical Breaches
Physical attacks remain a pervasive and destructive threat. Criminals increasingly utilize solid explosives or flammable gas (e.g., acetylene or propane) injected into the terminal's safe.7 These attacks are not only aimed at the immediate theft of cash but often cause significant collateral damage to the branch infrastructure and pose a severe life-safety risk to customers and staff.7 Brute-force methods such as "ram-raids" using heavy vehicles or "hook-and-chain" attacks remain prevalent in specific geographic markets.7
2.4 Compromise of Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)
The loss of Sensitive Authentication Data, including full track data, PIN blocks, and card security codes, is a critical risk that can lead to systemic fraud. PCI DSS v4.0 highlights the danger of storing SAD post-authorization.20 If an attacker gains access to the SST’s file system or intercepts network traffic, the presence of unencrypted or inadequately protected SAD allows for the cloning of cards and unauthorized transactions. The risk is particularly high during the transition period between legacy key management and modern TR-31 key block requirements.1
2.5 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Network Interception
SSTs communicating over public or poorly secured network infrastructures are vulnerable to MITM attacks. Attackers can intercept the communication between the terminal and the bank's host, allowing them to modify transaction amounts, spoof authorization responses, or capture sensitive data.7 For VTMs, this risk extends to the interception of high-definition video streams and scanned images of government-issued identification, which could lead to identity theft and account takeovers.23
2.6 Operating System (OS) Vulnerabilities and Malware
The vast majority of the global SST estate operates on the Windows platform. As Microsoft ends support for older versions (e.g., Windows 10 EOL), the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities increases dramatically.2 Malware specifically designed for the SST environment can be introduced via infected USB drives, remote access tools, or network exploits. Once installed, such malware can monitor keyboard inputs, intercept card data from the reader, and even control the cash dispenser.8
2.7 Cash Recycling and Counterfeit Recirculation
The deployment of Cash Recycling Machines (CRMs) introduces a unique operational risk: the receipt and subsequent re-dispensing of counterfeit currency to legitimate customers. If the CRM’s internal authentication sensors are not regularly updated or fail to meet the rigorous standards established by central banks (such as the ECB), the bank may inadvertently become a distributor of counterfeit currency, leading to severe reputational damage and legal liability.15
2.8 Insider Abuse and Privileged Access Exploitation
Malicious or coerced insiders, including bank employees and third-party maintenance technicians, pose a significant threat. These individuals often have legitimate access to physical keys, administrative passwords, and diagnostic software.8 Without robust privileged access management (PAM) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), an insider can disable security controls, plant malware, or directly steal cash while appearing to perform routine maintenance.10
2.9 Transaction Reversal Fraud (TRF) and Cash Trapping
TRF is a sophisticated manipulation of the transaction flow where an attacker creates an error condition during the dispense process, causing the host to reverse the transaction while the attacker physically retrieves the cash.7 Cash trapping involves the use of "claws" or adhesive strips placed inside the dispenser shutter to physically block the cash. The customer, believing the machine has failed, walks away, allowing the criminal to retrieve the trapped banknotes.8
10. Data Remnancy and Privacy Risks in Multi-Function Terminals
MFMs and VTMs often process sensitive documents, including check images, ID scans, and printed receipts. A critical risk is the failure to properly sanitize the terminal’s internal hard drive or memory after a transaction or at the end of the machine's life.17 If an MFM is disposed of or repaired without secure hard drive destruction, customer data—including personally identifiable information (PII)—can be recovered by unauthorized parties.17
3. Technical Security Standard Statements
To mitigate the top 10 risks, this section details the mandatory technical security standards for the global SST estate. These standards are mapped to industry best practices and regulatory requirements from the PCI Security Standards Council, MAS, HKMA, and the European Central Bank (ECB).
3.1 Physical Hardening and Environmental Controls
The physical security of the SST must be multi-layered, focusing on deterrence, detection, and delay.
3.1.1 Siting and Physical Placement
Terminals must be located in high-traffic, visible locations to eliminate hiding spots for criminals.38 Visibility must be enhanced through bright, reliable lighting and clear-glass vestibules where applicable.38 Landscaping must be regularly maintained to prevent the growth of vegetation that could obscure the machine or surveillance cameras.38
3.1.2 Anchoring and Structural Integrity
All standalone SST units must be securely anchored to the building structure using high-security mounting systems and anti-ram raid plinths.3 This is especially critical for terminals located in drive-up or non-branch environments. The safe housing must meet or exceed industry standards (e.g., CEN ratings) appropriate for the specific risk level of the location.7
3.1.3 Advanced Sensor Suites
Every terminal must be equipped with an array of environmental sensors to detect physical tampering attempts.

Sensor Type
Functional Requirement
Threat Mitigation
Vibration/Seismic
Detects drilling, cutting, or mechanical impact on the safe or chassis.14
Brute-force/Burglary
Tilt/Removal
Detects changes in the machine's orientation or attempts to remove it from its anchors.14
Ram-raid/Theft
Thermal/Heat
Detects the use of torches, lances, or high-temperature cutting equipment.14
Thermal safe breach
Gas Detection
Detects the presence of flammable gases within the safe enclosure.29
Explosive gas attack
Door/Tamper
Detects unauthorized opening of the fascia or the safe door.9
Black box/Malware planting

3.1.4 Intelligent Banknote Neutralization Systems (IBNS)
Where permitted by local law, SST cash cassettes should be equipped with ink-staining or chemical degradation technology.7 In the event of an unauthorized safe breach or removal of the cassette, the IBNS must permanently mark the banknotes, rendering them unusable and removing the incentive for the theft.7
3.1.5 Visual Surveillance and AI-Powered Monitoring
Each terminal must be integrated into a unified video management system (VMS). This system must include high-resolution cameras capable of low-light and infrared operation.21
Face Camera: Captures the customer's face during the transaction to deter social engineering and assist in fraud investigations.14
Dispenser Camera: Monitors the cash shutter and card reader area for shimming/skimming devices or cash trapping tools.14
AI Analytics: The VMS must utilize AI-powered analytics to identify suspicious behaviors, such as loitering, tailgating, facial obscuration, or multiple returns to the same machine within a short window.9
3.2 Logical Security and Operating System Hardening
The logical security of the SST is predicated on the "Single Use Device" principle. The machine should be hardened to a state where it can only perform authorized banking functions.
3.2.1 OS Hardening and "Rule 8" Implementation
All SSTs must run on a secured version of the operating system (e.g., Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC). The hardening process must adhere to the industry-standard "Rule 8" principles 31:
Disable Auto-Play: Prevent the automatic execution of software from removable media (USB, CD/DVD).31
Minimalist Configuration: Disable all unnecessary Windows features, management protocols (DHCP, SMTP, BOOTP), and interactive desktop components.17
Locked-Down User Account: The self-service application must run under a low-privileged user account with no interactive desktop access or ability to launch unauthorized shells.31
Registry and File System Lockdown: Implement strict permissions to ensure only authorized processes can modify critical system files or configuration settings.31
3.2.2 Application Whitelisting and Integrity Monitoring
The terminal must utilize advanced endpoint protection that incorporates application whitelisting (e.g., McAfee Solidcore, Symantec Critical System Protection).9
Positive Security Model: Block the execution of any binary file, script, or library not explicitly listed on the bank’s authorized whitelist.22
Sandboxing: High-risk applications should be contained within a sandbox to restrict their behavior and prevent them from interacting with the underlying OS or hardware in unauthorized ways.22
File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Continuously monitor critical system and application files for unauthorized changes. Any modification to a whitelisted file must trigger an immediate alert to the SOC.20
3.2.3 BIOS and Hardware Root-of-Trust
The hardware security of the terminal must start at the foundation of the boot process.
BIOS Protection: The Basic Input/Output System must be protected by a complex password and configured to boot only from the primary encrypted hard drive. All other boot options must be disabled.29
Trusted Platform Module (TPM): All new SST deployments must utilize TPM 2.0 to ensure the integrity of the boot sequence and provide a hardware-backed storage for cryptographic keys.40
Secure Boot: Enable UEFI Secure Boot to prevent the loading of unsigned or malicious bootloaders and drivers.9
3.2.4 Device Port Control
All internal and external communication ports (USB, Serial, Parallel) must be granularly controlled.22 The whitelisting solution must block all unauthorized devices from connecting to these ports. Any legitimate device (e.g., a maintenance keyboard or diagnostic tool) must be explicitly authorized by the hardware ID or digital signature.22
3.3 Cryptographic Standards and Key Management
Cryptography is the cornerstone of SST security, protecting both the integrity of the transaction and the privacy of the customer.
3.3.1 Encrypting PIN Pads (EPP) and PIN Protection
All SSTs must be equipped with PCI PTS 5.x+ compliant Encrypting PIN Pads.1
Hardware Encryption: PINs must be encrypted at the moment of entry within the tamper-resistant hardware of the EPP. At no point should a clear-text PIN be available to the terminal’s operating system or software.1
PIN Block Formats: The EPP must support modern PIN block formats that prevent brute-force and dictionary attacks.1
3.3.2 Symmetric Key Protection (TR-31)
The institution mandates the implementation of TR-31 (Interoperable Secure Key Block) for the packaging and protection of symmetric keys.1 TR-31 ensures that keys are bound to specific usage and exportability attributes, preventing them from being used for unauthorized purposes even if they are intercepted.1
3.3.3 Remote Key Loading (RKL) with TR-34
Manual, dual-custody key loading is a significant operational risk and is prohibited for all new and upgraded terminals. Remote Key Loading must be utilized, employing the TR-34 protocol.1
Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI): TR-34 uses asymmetric cryptography to securely transport TR-31 key blocks from the bank's central Host Security Module (HSM) to the terminal’s EPP.3
Certificate-Based Mutual Authentication: Both the terminal and the host must verify each other's identity using digital certificates before any key exchange occurs.1
3.3.4 End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) and TLS
All data transmitted between the SST and the acquirer host must be fully encrypted.
Transport Layer Security (TLS): Use TLS 1.2 as a minimum, with a strategic migration path to TLS 1.3. Older versions (SSL, TLS 1.0, 1.1) must be disabled.2
Transaction Signing: High-value transactions must be digitally signed to ensure integrity and non-repudiation. This involves a hash-based comparison to verify that the transaction details have not been tampered with during transit.41
3.4 Specialized Standards for Advanced Terminals
The diversity of the SST estate requires specific standards for specialized functions.
3.4.1 Cash Recycling Machines (CRM)
CRMs must adhere to the standards established by the European Central Bank (ECB) or equivalent national authorities for note authentication.33
Note Authentication: All CRMs must use banknote processing systems that have been successfully tested by a National Central Bank (NCB). The machine must be capable of detecting and separating fit, unfit, and counterfeit notes without manual intervention.33
Counterfeit Detection Updates: Banknote authentication software must be updated at least annually, or immediately upon the discovery of new counterfeit types by the central bank.33
Retraceability: For every deposit, the machine must capture the banknote serial numbers and "fingerprints," associating them with the specific customer ID for at least four weeks to allow for the recovery of counterfeit funds.33
3.4.2 Video Teller Machines (VTM/ITM)
VTMs present unique privacy and session integrity challenges.
Video Session Encryption: All audio and video streams must be end-to-end encrypted using DTLS and WebRTC protocols to prevent eavesdropping.23
Biometric Identity Verification: VTMs should integrate biometric sensors (facial recognition or fingerprint) to provide strong multi-factor authentication for remote transactions.9
Document Privacy: Document scanners must utilize encrypted local storage. All images must be securely transmitted to the core banking system and then permanently wiped from the terminal’s local storage using military-grade sanitization protocols.13
3.4.3 Multi-Function Machines (MFM) and Cheque Deposit
Hard Drive Sanitization: MFMs must be purchased with a clause allowing the bank to maintain physical custody of the hard drive during repair or at end-of-life.17
Print Spooler Protection: MFDs must be configured to restrict print jobs to authorized spoolers only, preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unauthorized large print jobs.17
Fax and Email Security: Outbound transmissions must be limited to authorized domains. Scanned documents containing PII must not be sent over unencrypted email channels.17
3.5 Network Security and Access Control
3.5.1 Micro-Segmentation and VLANs
SST networks must be logically isolated from all other bank systems. Each terminal should be placed within a micro-segmented VLAN with a default "deny-all" firewall policy.3 Traffic must be limited to the specific IP addresses and ports required for communication with the transaction host, the video management system, and the central management server.
3.5.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA is mandatory for all privileged access to the SST environment.1
Administrative Access: Any technician or engineer accessing the terminal’s OS or administrative interface must authenticate using MFA (e.g., a hardware token or biometrics combined with a complex password).1
Remote Management: Remote diagnostic and management tools (e.g., NCR Solidcore, Symantec) must require MFA for session initiation and must log all activities for auditing.31
3.5.3 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) must be strictly enforced.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define granular roles for maintenance, cash replenishment, and software management. Users must only be granted the permissions necessary to perform their specific functions.31
Session Termination: All administrative and maintenance sessions must automatically terminate after 15 minutes of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access if a technician leaves a session open.41

5. Governance and Operational Resilience
Technical controls alone are insufficient without a robust governance framework and a culture of security awareness.
5.1 Board and Senior Management Oversight
In accordance with MAS and HKMA guidelines, the technology risk management of the SST estate is a board-level priority.6 Senior management must define the risk appetite for the SST channel, approve security policies, and regularly review risk reports, including metrics on system availability, security incidents, and compliance status.10
5.2 Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk Management (TPRM)
The institution relies heavily on third-party vendors for SST hardware, software, and maintenance.
Due Diligence: Conduct thorough security assessments of all vendors before engagement.18
Contractual Safeguards: Contracts must include specific clauses addressing data handling, access controls, breach notification timelines (often within hours), and the bank’s right to audit the vendor’s security controls.18
Supply Chain Monitoring: Monitor for geopolitical risks or financial instability that could affect the vendor’s ability to provide critical software patches or hardware components (e.g., the 6-9 month backlog for EPPs).1
5.3 Performance Monitoring and Incident Management
Automated Monitoring: Implement automated systems to detect terminal interruptions, network degradation, or suspicious transaction patterns.6
4-Hour Recovery RTO: For critical systems, the institution must establish a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of four hours from the moment a major disruption is detected.10
Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Every security incident or major system failure must be subject to a comprehensive RCA to identify the underlying cause and implement preventive measures to avoid recurrence.37
5.4 Security Awareness and Training
Staff Training: All bank employees, especially those involved in branch operations and SST maintenance, must undergo annual security awareness training.57 This training must cover physical security risks (skimming detection, ram-raids), logical threats (phishing, social engineering), and the institution’s incident reporting procedures.37
Customer Education: The bank must provide customers with clear, accessible information on how to use SSTs safely. This includes tips on shielding PIN entry, recognizing signs of card reader tampering, and identifying social engineering scams.6
6. Future Outlook and Continuous Improvement
The SST threat landscape is dynamic, with criminals constantly innovating to bypass security controls. As a world-class principal security architect, the objective is to maintain a proactive defense strategy.
AI for Cybersecurity: The institution will increasingly leverage AI and machine learning to analyze the vast streams of data generated by the SST estate. This includes correlating sensor data, video analytics, and transaction logs to identify anomalous behavior in real-time.9
Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Looking toward the 2030 horizon, the institution must begin evaluating cryptographic algorithms that can withstand the potential emergence of quantum computing.
Expansion of Biometrics: The goal is to move beyond the physical card and PIN where possible, utilizing multi-modal biometrics (facial, voice, and palm vein) to provide a more secure and seamless customer experience.9
Industry Collaboration: We will continue to participate in global industry bodies like the PCI SSC, the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA), and the ATM Security Association (ASA) to share threat intelligence and contribute to the development of robust international security standards.25
